Light Tracking
-Video Bright Spot Detection and Measurement

Description:
This project is focused on detecting the two brightest spots in a video sequence, measuring the distance between them, and highlighting these spots with visual markers. This application can be useful in various fields such as automated visual inspection systems, robotics, and more.

Key Features:

Brightness Enhancement: Adjusts the video's gamma to enhance visibility even in low-light conditions.
Spot Detection: Utilizes thresholding and contour detection to identify the brightest areas.
Distance Measurement: Calculates and displays the distance between the two brightest spots in real-time.
Visual Feedback: Marks detected spots with green circles and orange rectangles, and displays the distance directly on the video.
Output:
The processed video is saved with visual indications of detection and measurements, providing a straightforward way to review and analyze the detected spots and their distances.

This script provides a robust tool for analyzing video data to automatically detect and measure significant bright areas, useful for various applications in science and industry.
